        <h3>Lyrics</h3>
        <p class="line1 lobster">Thought I almost died in my dream again (baby, almost died)</p>
        <p class="line2">Fightin' for my life, I couldn't breathe again</p>
        <p class="line3 pacifico">I'm fallin' in too deep (oh)</p>
        <p class="line4 dancing">Without you, don't wanna sleep (fallin' in)</p>
        <p class="line5 pacifico">Cause my <b>heart</b> belongs to you</p>
        <p class="line6 lobster">I'll risk it all for you</p>
        <p class="line7">I want you next to me</p>
        <p class="line8 brush">This time, I'll never leave</p>
        <p class="line9">I wanna share babies</p>
        <p class="line10"><i>Protection</i>, we won't need</p>
        <p class="line11">Your body next to me</p>
        <p class="line12 brush">Is just a memory</p>
        <p class="line13 pacifico">I'm fallin' in too deep, oh</p>
        <p class="line14 brush">Without you, I can't sleep</p>
        <p class="line15 dancing"><i>Insomnia</i> relieve, oh</p>
        <p class="line16 dancing">Talk to me, without you I can't breathe</p>
        <p class="line17">My <b>darkest</b> hours</p>
        <p class="line18 dancing">Girl, I felt so alone inside of this crowded room</p>
        <p class="line19 brush">Different girls on the floor, distracting my thoughts of you</p>
        <p class="line20">I turned into the man I used to be, to be</p>
        <p class="line21 lobster">Put myself to sleep</p>
        <p class="line22 pacifico">Just so I can get closer to you inside my <em>dreams</em></p>
        <p class="line23">Didn't wanna wake up 'less you were beside me</p>
        <p class="line24">I just wanted to call you and say, and say</p>
        <p class="line25 brush">Oh, baby, where are you now when I need you most?</p>
        <p class="line26 dancing">I'd give it all just to hold you close</p>
        <p class="line27 pacifico">Sorry that I broke your <b>heart</b>, your <b>heart</b></p>
        <p class="line28 lobster">Never comin' down, uh</p>
        <p class="line29 brush">I was runnin' away from facin' <i>reality</i>, uh</p>
        <p class="line30">Wastin' all of my time on livin' my <em>fantasies</em></p>
        <p class="line31">Spendin' money to compensate, compensate</p>
        <p class="line32 pacifico">Cause I want you baby</p>
        <p class="line33">I'll be livin' in Heaven when I'm inside of you</p>
        <p class="line34">It was definitely a blessing wakin' beside you</p>
        <p class="line35 lobster">I'll never let you down again, again</p>
        <p class="line36">Oh, baby, where are you now when I need you most?</p>
        <p class="line37">I'd give it all just to hold you close</p>
        <p class="line38 lobster">Sorry that I broke your <b>heart</b>, your <b>heart</b></p>
        <p class="line39 brush">I said, baby, I'll treat you better than I did before</p>
        <p class="line40">I'll hold you down and not let you go</p>
        <p class="line41 pacifico">This time I won't break your <strong>heart</strong>, your <strong>heart</strong>, yeah</p>
        <p class="line42 pacifico">I know it's all my fault</p>
        <p class="line43">Made you put down your guard</p>
        <p class="line44 brush">I know I made you fall</p>
        <p class="line45">Then said you were wrong for me</p>
        <p class="line46 dancing">I lied to you, I lied to you, I lied to you (to you)</p>
        <p class="line47">Can't hide the truth, I stayed with her in spite of you</p>
        <p class="line48">You did some things that you regret, still ride for you</p>
        <p class="line49 dancing">Cause this house is not a home</p>
        <p class="line50">Without my baby, where are you now when I need you most?</p>
        <p class="line51">I gave it all just to hold you close</p>
        <p class="line52 brush">Sorry that I broke your <em>heart</em>, your <em>heart</em></p>
        <p class="line53 dancing">And I said, baby, I'll treat you better than I did before</p>
        <p class="line54 lobster">I'll hold you down and not let you go</p>
        <p class="line55 pacifico">This time I won't break your <strong>heart</strong>, your <strong>heart</strong>, no</p>
